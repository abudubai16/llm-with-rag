Enhancing Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Objective: 
To improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating a retrieval-augmented generation system that provides up-to-date, specialized knowledge.
Key Components:
LLMs: Understanding the general working principle behind LLM and why they are so revolutionary in Deep Learning.  
RAG Overview: Introduces RAG as a solution to enhance LLMs by connecting them to a mutable, domain-specific knowledge base
A more comprehensive breakdown:
Details of libraries and programming language:
	Pytorch with Python is probably the most commonly used library and language pair for the development of cutting edge LLM models. Even if you have only ever used TensorFlow before it is alright for the most part the coding part translates quite well across the two libraries, just syntactic differences exist and even those can be overcome easily. Llama-index is one useful library that allows you to create RAG’s relatively easily. 
  
  what is the best way to do this??

If possible it is good to look into other useful libraries like Hydra and Pytorch-Lightning, which are used for rapid prototyping and testing purposes (Hydra can get a little complicated if you are new to running configurations from the CLI). These are highly coveted skills in a lot of research based companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and developers of Grok (under Elon Musk) all extensively use such libraries. But it is not required that you look into them, from experience I can say without a good understanding of Pytorch using them will not be easy. 

Text Datasets:
	https://pytorch.org/text/stable/datasets.html#language-modeling, refer to this page for libraries that you can use. Provided you are training the model from scratch, though its not recommended we want everyone to at least have the opportunity to test things out. 

Model Selection:
It is best to use pretrained models such as Llama-3 8B or some other relatively small models for this purpose and combine them with a standard RAG API’s or something similar. A variety of language models can be used for this purpose, HuggingFace has a wonderful collection of such models. Everyone is recommended to go through some of these models and experiment with what works best. Trying a lot of different things and evaluating them based on certain criteria/metrics is the best way to build a good understanding of such models.

Training the Model:
Look into LoRa and other techniques to train big models like this that cannot lazily be uploaded into GPU RAM or the system RAM cannot handle such a huge datasets.  

Evaluation:
Evaluate the generated captions using metrics like Answer Consistency Metric, Answer Match Metric, and other metrics. 

Net Output:
Enhanced Responses: The integration of RAG allows the LLM to generate responses that are more accurate and contextually relevant, especially for technical queries.
Tools Used:
Retriever: A component that searches a knowledge base for information relevant to a user’s query Knowledge Base: A mutable database containing domain-specific information that can be updated as needed
Text Embeddings: Utilized for searching the knowledge base by representing text as numerical vectors
Vector Database: Stores text embeddings for efficient retrieval
This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of RAG in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs, particularly in responding to technical questions with greater precision and relevance.
